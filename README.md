# Sensor Fusion Test
## Generate End to end Expected Output - Given Input Data pairs

This project expects python3 and a linux environment

You may install the dependencies for this project from the `requirements.txt` file using `pip3 install requirements.txt` 
matplotlib may have a dependency on tkinter, which you may resolve using `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` before installing the requirements


To develop using a data visualization assist, please install `entr` using `sudo apt-get install entr`

this will allow you to use 
`cd debugtools/visualization/`
`sh runGroundTruthGeneratorAndVisualiseData.sh`

as a way to rapidly visualize the changes done to this file. This script runs the groundTruthDataGenerator.py file and visualizes the csv file it generates every time you save changes to the file.

givenInputGenerator.py uses the expectedOutputData.csv generated by groundTruthDataGenerator.py inside the `./dist/` folder to generate 3 more files inside `./dist/`

to work on changes to givenInputGenerator.py, something similar as above exists by running
`cd debugtools/visualization/` 
`sh runGivenDataGeneratorAndVisualiseData.sh`, allowing you to visualize the output of givenDataGenerator.py

There is also a way to generate a callgraph of the entire python program file by running 

`cd debugTools/visualization`
`sh callgraphVisualizationGivenInputGenerator.sh`
or 
`cd debugTools/visualization`
`sh callgraphVisualizationGivenInputGenerator.sh`

to visualize the callgraphs of the respective programs, 

To run these, we require chrome or chromium, and for one window of chrome open. 
we require `chromix-too`, wich consists of a cli tool that can be installed using npm here: [chromix-too](https://github.com/smblott-github/chromix-too)
and also its [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromix-too/ppapdfccnamacakfkpfmpfnefpeajboj)

then we run `chromix-too-server` in another terminal and leave it running for us to take advantage of these callgraphVisualization scripts
